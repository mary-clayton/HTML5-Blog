									<h2>Lambda Experience: Journey from Current Student to Labs</h2>
									<p> update: Feb 23, 2020</p>
								</header>
								<p>
                                    It has been a strenuous six months and finally made it to labs. What happened
                                    during the course though is that I flexed once, so I took advanced react a second
                                    time. It was a good experience though, because that unit is usually pretty hard to
                                    master and it wasn't just me that was struggling with it. What was hard was CRUD 
                                    operations on the front end side because it was a struggle to get them working properly 
                                    like they should.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Not to mention I also switched from WEB23 to WEBPT9 as well, making this experience longer,
                                    but I feel like more time will be worth it in the end. I did end up getting a really cool
                                    internship as an AI Engineer. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    But, let's that for another post. For any one who is struggling
                                    through front-end right now, I urge you to keep moving forward. When you reach backend, it gets
                                    easier. Backend isn't too bad and I've actually enjoyed the experience and it is less pressuring
                                    to focus on the look on the website and more on the functionality of the website.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Now that I summarized my experience so far, the good stuff is yet to come. Labs is next after build
                                    week and people have described it to be build week on steroids. Compared to the part time from the 
                                    full time experience, Labs is much, much longer in the part time courses than the full time. Part time
                                    is 16 weeks long. That's 4 months long compared to a two months long Labs.

									<p>
                                        Lambda School has treated me with the most honorable respect
                                         as well as my peers and with this new knowledge and experience 
                                         I take with me. I hope to make good use of it when I get a successful
                                         career in doing what I most love to do, coding. For anyone who is struggling
                                         to find that, don't give up because success can be the happiness you can be 
                                         looking for and Lambda School helps out students of any situation grow and 
                                         find their calling. Cheers.
                                        </p>
