									<h2>Pre-Lambda Experience: Journey From Applicant to Current Student</h2>
									<p>Updated: Aug 4, 2019</p>
								</header>
								<p>
		

Lambda School has been a positive outlook to me since I have found it through a Facebook ad questioning whether it was for real. I applied for Lambda School deciding to start my future changing career paths from a 3D artist/visual development artist to a Full Stack Web Developer.
<br><br>
Ever since I was young, art and coding have both been passions, yet first was art, then now coding. Now I pray for success in this journey I am going on to be a successful Web Developer. The application process took about two weeks to finally get back to me then the video interview was required. I wanted to focus on my passions for coding and my determination to go through school again. Not that long after, I was accepted into Lambda School. 
<br><br>
I accomplished something not many others can reach for their first time and they realized my potential in becoming a successful candidate. 


What came after was one of the most rewarding experiences and challenging feats was the intro of web development course in addition to the coding challenge. 
<br><br>
The course was long and tedious requiring many hours of work, but after finishing it within the free time I have, it only took 1 week to finish it. 
I already know HTML and CSS, so those were a breeze to accomplish. However, JavaScript with no prior experience with this language, had been one of the challenging parts of the course. 
Additional help was needed and I would like to thank Brooke for helping me with these difficult questions I didn't understand. 
<br><br>
I can't thank enough of the people who took their time to help explain my mistakes. 
Lastly, the coding challenge would be the major milestone to my journey as a web developer.


The coding challenges was only 1 example question + 3 questions that are timed for 45 minutes. Sounds easy enough right? Not if you're a beginner at JavaScript. Many people I saw re-tried this challenge 3-5 tries on average to pass and some didn't pass having to go to the next session. I was one of the average ones who had passed it after 3 tries and it was an accomplishment I can't express that had me feeling confident in JavaScript more so. My advice for any newbies at coding/JavaScript is:



								</p>
								<p>
									1. Practice, Practice, Practice! <br>

Practicing JavaScript will be the best tool you will get, because without practice even with cheat sheets, you won't be able to apply it without practicing the fundamentals. This will be your best friend when getting through the coding challenge.

<br><br>
2. Take Notes 
<br>
It seems tedious work, but writing down the code you learn can be great reference to when you are stuck and need an example or need the basic format of how a certain code works. 

<br><br>
3. Don't beat yourself up 
<br>
if you don't get it the first couple tries.

Be nice to yourself. Not everyone will get it the first time around. Treat yourself, take a break, go on a walk, do what you can to unwind, then go back to it. Don't stress over each question.
